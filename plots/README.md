# plots

Scripts in this directory are used to plot quantities of interest prior to production runs.

The plots here exist in better forms in the Figures and Figures_SI directories, but these files may be useful if you modify the MKMs.

| Script | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `coverage.plot` | coverage vs pH and potential plot
| `lsv.plot` | log current vs potential plot
| `polarization.plot` | current vs potential plot
| `rate_control.plot` | rate control plots
| `selectivity_new.plot` | selectivity plot
| `singlepH_coverages.plot` | coverage vs potential plot
